App also includes a VR walk-through of a Virtual Bank to familiarize customers of the different things you can do in a branch and also to promote the bank's ongoing promos or marketing campaigns. The property viewer will contain a \"dibs/I'm Interested\" button that submits the user's contact info, making it easier for the bank to contact new leads. This can help the bank increase its market reach faster. As for the users, this decreases guess work and logistics by cutting the need to go to the actual site just by experiencing the interactive photo-spheres and real-time 3D spaces that eventually speed up buyers'  decision to buy or not.",
